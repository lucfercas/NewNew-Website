                <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                <p>Hi! üëã I‚Äôm Luc√≠a, and it is very nice to meet you!</p>

                <p> Ever since I can remember I have enjoyed pulling things apart and learning how they work, from
                    puzzles, little games to cameras, old school cinema techniques and generative art. Now I am
                    interested in software.

                    Creativity rules my life, and solving problems and helping people keep me going.</p>

                <p> I grew up in a coastal town in sunny Andalusia, but I have lived in the UK for the past 7 years.
                    What was meant to be a year abroad to work and learn English, turned into the adventure of my
                    lifetime. I started in Manchester, to then move into London, where I‚Äôve been living since.

                    During that time, not being able to decide where to focus my career efforts, I have spent my years
                    between hospitality roles, up until I decided to go to university and pursue a creative path:
                    design.</p>
                

                <p><strong>The start of a coding journey‚Ä¶</strong></p>

                <p> During my studies I came across creative coding using Arduino boards, and Processing, which blew my
                    mind. The vast creative possibilities inspired me to want to know more about different applications
                    of code in real life, and to discover new technologies. This coding affair felt good but brief, and
                    the idea of becoming somehow involved with coding in a day to day basis sparked.

                    While I loved my degree, being a recent graduate without a support network in a time of crisis has
                    been tough, which is why I had to go back to the hospitality industry. Pairing that with my desire
                    of improvement made me join this new and exciting journey that it is learning to code properly. </p>

            <div id="why-fac" class="text-container">
                <h2>Why FAC?</h2>
                <p>Definitely the people. During my time attending the support group I had the chance not only to
                    experience how peer learning is offered and encouraged, but also to appreciate the support mentors
                    and past members of FAC gave us. I have learnt plenty from other applicants, and I have also had the
                    chance to help and encourage my peers when needed. I don‚Äôt think I would have learnt as much as I
                    have in a short period of time if I had to go through this application alone, without being able to
                    discuss ideas, solutions and ask questions. Based on these past months, FAC is the place to be.</p>

            <div id="why-sd" class="text-container">
                <h2>Why a career in software development?</h2>
                <p>Software development is an ever evolving career, which means continuous learning and development of
                    skills. It seems like there is always something new to learn, which offers the opportunity to grow
                    and keeps your brain challenged, which I find really attractive. I also enjoy the idea of applying
                    my innate creativity to solve problems and help people while working collectively. I found myself
                    performing and enjoying myself more when I have taken part in group projects. I have recently learnt
                    about ways in which coding impacts society and the fact that it can help people‚Äôs lives. The chance
                    to work with conscious companies in exciting roles inspired me to pursue this course and career
                    path. And last, I am truly interested in the career opportunities software development is offering,
                    it is an exciting time to be involved in the tech industry!</p>
